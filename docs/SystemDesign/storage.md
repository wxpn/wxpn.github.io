## Storage
If we think of any system we are designing, that system will require some form of storage - information on user, process. This is where database comes into picture. A database is where one can store and retrieve data. There are two types of popular storage:
- Disk - Data is persistence even if the server is shutdown.
- Memory - Data is not persistent, and if the server is shutdown or goes down due to an outage, all data is lost. Note that in-memory access is much faster than disk access.

There are several type of database offerings and these are based on the type of the data stored in the database.
