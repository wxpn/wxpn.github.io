# System Design
System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specific requirements. It involves creating a detailed plan for a system's construction and operation, including the selection of hardware and software components and their integration into a functional whole.

System design can be applied to a wide range of fields, including software development, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. The goal of system design is to create a system that meets the needs of its users and stakeholders, is reliable, efficient, and scalable, and is capable of being maintained and updated as needed.
