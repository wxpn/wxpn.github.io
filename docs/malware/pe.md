# What is a PE ?
The Portable Executable, commonly referred to as PE, is a file stored on disk that the Loader component of the Windows operating system can read, load into memory, and execute. To visualize the structure of a PE file, we can observe the various headers, structures, and section tables that it contains. Refer to the below picture from [wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Portable_Executable_32_bit_Structure_in_SVG_fixed.svg).

As you see, there are lots of headers, structures and section tables, and it may seem overwelming when we look at it initially, but for understanding purposes we can simplify this with this [link](https://github.com/corkami/pics/blob/master/binary/pe101/pe101.png). In a nutshell, PE file can be considered as a book. A book generally has two parts to it, "data" which contains authors text / content and "metadata" which includes information like title, author, publisher, data, ToC, etc.
